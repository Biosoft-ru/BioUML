# Supergoal execution protocol

This file is read by the executing agent at the start of the single `/goal` session and followed throughout. It is the operating manual for the autonomous run.

All paths below are rooted at this run's artifact directory (`.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs`) — the concrete namespaced path is baked in when this file is copied at Stage 7, so two runs in the same working tree read and write entirely separate artifacts.

## The loop

Repeat until `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE` is printed:

1. Read `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/STATE.md`. Find `Current phase: N`.
2. Read `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/phases/phase-N.md`. This is your full work spec.
3. Print `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_START` with the spec's metadata (phase number, name, task, mandatory commands, acceptance count, evidence types, dependencies).
4. Do the work described in the spec. Run mandatory commands. Surface evidence into the transcript (command output last ~10 lines + exit code; file listings; key diff excerpts).
5. Print `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_VERIFY`: each acceptance criterion `pass|fail` with evidence; engineering checks (build/typecheck/lint/tests); **cleanliness checks** — run `bash .supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/repo-state.sh added-lines <Baseline ref>` (the complete set of added/new lines since baseline, **including uncommitted and untracked work**) and grep it for stack-specific debug patterns — `console.log`/`console.error` for JS/TS; `print(`/`pprint(` for Python; `print(`/`dump(` for Swift; `fmt.Println`/`log.Println` for Go; session TODO/FIXME added this phase; dead imports added; files changed count via `bash .supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/repo-state.sh changed-files <Baseline ref> | wc -l`; notable diff one-liners. Any non-zero cleanliness count triggers the same 3-strike treatment as a failed criterion unless the phase spec explicitly declares a `Cleanliness override:` line (e.g., a debug-tooling phase legitimately ships logs). The complete-working-tree comparison is documented once in `references/repo-state-comparison.md`.
6. **Memory writeback check.** Anything non-obvious learned this phase? If yes, write a memory file under the detected MEM_DIR (frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `metadata.type` of `feedback`/`project`/`reference`/`user`); link it from `MEMORY.md`. Print `MEMORY_SAVED: <name>` or `MEMORY_SAVED: none`.
7. Print `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE`. Update `STATE.md`: mark phase N completed; set `Current phase: N+1`; bump `Last update` timestamp; append a one-line event.
8. **User-interrupt check.** If a user message has arrived since the last turn, pause; address the message; ask before resuming.
9. If N < total phases: continue with phase N+1 (back to step 1).
10. If N == total: do **not** print `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE` yet. Run the **Final audit** below. Only after `AUDIT_COMPLETE`, print `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE` with a 5-line summary. The `/goal` condition is satisfied at that point.

## Final audit (Stage 10 — runs after the last phase, before completion)

Per-phase VERIFY blocks are self-reports. The audit closes that loophole by re-validating against the **original** `ROADMAP.md`, not against this run's own self-reports. The audit runs up to 3 rounds; on the 3rd round's failure, `AUDIT_HANDOFF`.

### Audit steps (one round)

1. Print `AUDIT_START` (round number, total phase count, criteria count, deduplicated mandatory commands to re-run).
2. Re-read `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/ROADMAP.md` and pull every phase's acceptance criteria fresh from the original plan.
3. **Phase completeness:** scan the transcript for one `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE` per phase 1..N. Any missing = an `AUDIT_GAP`.
4. **Re-run aggregated mandatory commands** once each (build / typecheck / lint / full test suite — whatever the union of all phases' mandatory commands is, deduplicated). Surface last ~10 lines + exit code. Non-zero exit = an `AUDIT_GAP`.
5. **Spot-check verifiable acceptance criteria** across all phases:
   - "File X exists" / "Function Y exported" / "Config key Z set" / "No `console.log` in app code" → re-check via `ls`/`grep`/`cat`.
   - "Screenshot showed X" / "Manual smoke test passed" / non-deterministic checks → mark `trust-prior-verify`, don't re-run.
5b. **Deliverable check** — for each phase block in `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/ROADMAP.md`, parse the `**Deliverables:**` bullets. For every bullet that names a file path or glob:
   - Read `Baseline ref:` from `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/STATE.md`.
   - Run `bash .supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/repo-state.sh deliverable <baseline-ref> "<path>"`. It compares the **complete working tree** (committed + staged + unstaged + deleted) against the baseline and detects untracked new files separately, printing `present — <evidence>` (exit 0) or `missing` (exit 1). An invalid/unavailable baseline degrades to a filesystem existence check. Strategy: `references/repo-state-comparison.md`.
   - `missing` (exit 1) → `AUDIT_GAP: phase <N> deliverable "<bullet>" not present in working tree or diff`.
   - This is repository ground truth, not transcript self-report — it catches the "agent said done but didn't ship" case the per-phase VERIFY cannot, even when the run never committed.
6. Print `AUDIT_VERIFY` with each phase's status, each command's exit, each criterion's pass/fail/trust-prior + evidence, and a `Deliverables:` block summarizing the step-5b check (`<deliverable>: present|missing` lines).

### If gaps found

1. Print `AUDIT_GAPS` with the list.
2. Write `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/phases/audit-fix-<round>.md` — a focused fix spec that targets only the failing criteria. Forbid scope creep. Use the affected phases' original VERIFY as the success gate.
3. Execute the fix spec inline (same agent, same `/goal`, same per-criterion 3-strike protocol from regular phases).
4. On fix success: loop back to step 1 of the audit (round + 1).
5. On 3rd round's audit failure: print `AUDIT_HANDOFF` (full gap history, suggested next move), update `STATE.md` to `BLOCKED`, stop. Do **not** print `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`.

### If zero gaps

1. Compute `audit coverage`: `re_verified / (re_verified + trust_prior)` as a percentage. `re_verified` = criteria with `pass` from step 5 + deliverables marked `present` from step 5b. `trust_prior` = criteria marked `trust-prior-verify`.
2. Print `AUDIT_COMPLETE` (rounds, phases re-verified, commands re-run clean, criteria pass / trust-prior counts, **audit coverage %**).
3. Print `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE` with the 5-line summary. If `trust_prior / (re_verified + trust_prior)` > **30%**, prepend a one-line honesty banner: `⚠ Audit coverage: <re_verified> re-verified, <trust_prior> trust-prior (<pct>%). Eyeball UI/UX before merging.` Below 30%, print the same coverage line without the warning prefix.

## Failure recovery (3-strike)

### First failure of any acceptance criterion

1. Print `FAILURE_PROBE` (phase, failed criterion, what was tried, root-cause hypothesis).
2. Append the probe to `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/STATE.md` failure log.
3. **Auto-retry the same phase once.** Inject the probe as a "Previous attempt failed because: …" preamble. Do not advance.

### Second failure (auto-retry also failed)

1. Print `FAILURE_ESCALATE`.
2. Write a focused **fix spec** at `.supergoal/server-monitoring-profiling-RA68Rs/phases/phase-N.fix.md`. The fix spec:
   - Targets only the failing criterion.
   - Forbids scope creep ("do not touch unrelated files").
   - Ends with the original phase's VERIFY block as the success gate.
3. Execute the fix spec inline (same agent, same `/goal` — no new dispatch).
4. On fix success: re-run the original phase's VERIFY; on pass, advance to N+1.
5. On fix failure: proceed to third-failure handling.

### Third failure (fix spec also failed)

1. Print `FAILURE_HANDOFF`: failing criterion, full probe history (three attempts), suggested next move.
2. Update `STATE.md`: `Status: BLOCKED`.
3. Stop attempting. The user takes the wheel. The `/goal` condition will not be satisfied; surface the handoff clearly so the host evaluator and user both see it.

## Mid-run interruption

If the user sends any message during the run:
- Pause at the next phase boundary (after `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE`, before reading the next spec).
- Address the message.
- Ask whether to resume, revise the next phase spec, or stop.

## Memory writeback rules

See `memory_writeback_rules` section in SKILL.md. Short version:

- Save anything non-obvious a future Supergoal run on a similar task would benefit from.
- Frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `metadata.type` (feedback / project / reference / user).
- Link from `MEMORY.md`.
- Final phase always writes a `project_<slug>.md` memory.
- Never save secrets, transient task details, or ephemeral state.

## Required transcript blocks

See `references/goal-format.md` for the exact format of:
- `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_START`
- `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_VERIFY`
- `MEMORY_SAVED`
- `SUPERGOAL_PHASE_DONE`
- `AUDIT_START` / `AUDIT_VERIFY` / `AUDIT_GAPS` / `AUDIT_COMPLETE` / `AUDIT_HANDOFF`
- `SUPERGOAL_RUN_COMPLETE`
- `FAILURE_PROBE` / `FAILURE_ESCALATE` / `FAILURE_HANDOFF`

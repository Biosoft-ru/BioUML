|DNA_binding_domain||
|C0001||zinc finger; 2.3.|Zinc finger motif of TFIIIA/Krueppel type. Each finger comprises 2 cysteine and 2 histidine residues coordinating one zinc ion, in some cases one histidine is replaced by another cysteine. The zinc ion is essential for DNA-binding. The first half of the finger sequence is generally organized in two antiparallel beta-strands, the second half as an alpha-helix and partly as an 310-helix. Hydrophobic contacts between the beta-strands and the alpha-helix are formed by the conserved phenylalanine and leucine residues. The alpha-helix binds to DNA through the major groove. The finger link frequently is TGEKPY. 
|C0002||zinc finger; zinc twist; 2.1.|Zinc finger motif of nuclear receptor type. Two such motifs differing in size, composition and function are present in each receptor molecule. Each finger comprises 4 cysteine residues coordinating one zinc ion. The second half including the second cysteine pair has alpha-helix conformation, the helix of the first finger binds to the DNA through the major groove. The sequence between the first two cysteines of the second finger mediates dimerization upon DNA-binding 
|C0003||zinc finger; 2.2.|Zinc finger motif of GATA-type. Can be subclassified into two sub-types, one of which is found in animal factors, the other one in plant factors. In fungi factors from both groups have been found. Most known animal GATA factors contain two zinc finger domains; most known fungal, plant and slime mold GATA factors only one [1]. In case of the two-fingered factors, as far as it has been investigated, only the C-terminal zinc finger plus an adjacent basic region are essential and sufficient for DNA-binding  [4] [2] [5]. Each finger comprises 4 cysteine residues coordinating one zinc ion. The DNA-binding zinc finger is composed of two irregular antiparallel beta-sheets and an alpha-helix; similar in structure, although not in sequence to the zinc finger of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain. The alpha-helix and the loop connecting the two antiparallel beta-sheets interact with the major groove of the DNA. The basic region carboxyl-terminal to the zinc finger wraps around into the minor groove [3]. 
|C0004||zinc finger.|Zinc finger motif of C4 type. Each finger comprises 4 cysteine residues presumably coordinating one zinc ion. 
|C0005||zinc cluster; zinc-cysteine cluster; C6 zinc finger; 2.4.|Zinc finger motif of GAL4-type. Present to date in many fungal regulators. The proteins are typically, though not exclusively transcriptional activators. Six cysteine residues coordinate two zinc ions, i. e. two of the thiol groups coordinate two zinc ions (six cysteines binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain). All GAL4-type proteins possess a single N-terminal zinc finger  with an adjacent basic region, which is critical for sequence-specific recognition. Each C3-repeat unit of the structural motif of six cysteines forms short alpha-helical structures separated by a loop with a proline-associated turn. A number of zinc cluster proteins contain leucine zipper-like heptad repeat motifs C-terminal to the zinc-cluster. These motifs have been shown to form coiled-coil structures involved in protein-protein interactions (often homodimerization). The GAL-4 protein binds as a dimer to DNA sites characterized by the presence of two CGG triplets separated by 11 base pairs. The zinc(II)-binding cluster lies in the DNA major groove and contacts three base pairs. 
|C0006||homeodomain; homeobox protein; 3.1.|Three consecutive alpha-helix structures, helix 3 contacts mainly the major groove of the DNA, some contacts at the minor groove are observed as well. Helix 2 and 3 resemble the helix-turn-helix structure of prokaryotic regulators. 
|C0007||POU domain; 3.1.2.|The POU domain consists of a POU-specific box and an appropriately spaced homeodomain. The POU-specific box consists of two subdomains (A and B), each of them probably comprising an alpha-helix and enriched in basic or hydroxyl amino acids, resp. The POU-specific box bends DNA. The term POU is derived from Pit-1, Oct-factors and Unc-86. 
|C0008||basic region + leucine zipper; 1.1.|A DNA-binding basic region is followed by a leucine zipper. The leucine zipper consists of repeated leucine residues at every seventh position and mediates protein dimerization as a prerequisite for DNA-binding. The leucines are directed towards one side of an alpha-helix. The leucine side chains of two polypeptides are thought to interdigitate upon dimerization (knobs-into-holes model). The leucine zipper dictates dimerization specificity. Upon DNA-binding of the dimer, the basic regions adopt alpha-helical conformation as well. Possibly, a sharp angulation point separates two alpha-helices of the subregions A and B leading to the scissors grip model for the bZIP-DNA complex. The DNA is contacted through the major groove over a whole turn. (PROSITE motif for Fos-Jun bZIP region only!) 
|C0009||leucine zipper; 1.1.6.|A potential leucine zipper that is not preceded by a basic domain. The leucine zipper consists of repeated leucine residues at every seventh position and mediates protein dimerization as a prerequisite for DNA-binding. The leucines are directed towards one side of an alpha-helix. The leucine side chains of two polypeptides are thought to interdigitate upon dimerization (knobs-into-holes model). The leucine zipper may dictate dimerization specificity. 
|C0010||basic region + helix-loop-helix motif; 1.2.|A DNA-binding basic region is followed by a motif of two potential amphipathic alpha-helices connected by a loop of variable length, possibly an omega loop. This putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif mediates dimerization as a prerequisite for DNA-binding. Upon dimerization, the alpha-helical content may significantly increase supporting the model of a four-helix bundle dimerization interface. Probably, the HLH domains of both dimer constituents are arranged in a parallel orientation. The basic region dictates DNA-binding specificity. Upon DNA-binding of the dimer, the basic regions adopt alpha-helical conformation as well. 
|C0011||helix-loop-helix motif; 1.2.8.|Two potential amphipathic alpha-helices are connected by a loop of variable length, possibly an omega loop. This putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif mediates dimerization. Upon dimerization, the alpha-helical content may significantly increase supporting the model of a four-helix bundle dimerization interface. Probably, the HLH domains of both dimer constituents are arranged in a parallel orientation. 
|C0012||basic region + helix-loop-helix motif + leucine zipper; 1.3.|A DNA-binding basic region is followed by a motif of two potential amphipathic alpha-helices connected by a loop of variable length, possibly an omega loop, and a leucine zipper motif. The putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif mediates dimerization as a prerequisite for DNA-binding. Upon dimerization, the alpha-helical content may significantly increase supporting the model of a four-helix bundle dimerization interface. Probably, the HLH domains of both dimer constituents are arranged in a parallel orientation. The basic region dictates DNA-binding specificity. Upon DNA-binding of the dimer, the basic regions adopt alpha-helical conformation as well. The leucine zipper consists of repeated leucine residues at every seventh position. The leucines are directed towards one side of an alpha-helix. The leucine side chains of two polypeptides are thought to interdigitate upon dimerization. The leucine zipper of bHLH-ZIP proteins may be involved in protein dimerization reactions as well. 
|C0013||helix-loop-helix motif + leucine zipper.|The molecule contains a motif of two potential amphipathic alpha-helices connected by a loop of variable length, possibly an omega loop, and a leucine zipper motif, but no basic domain. The putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif mediates dimerization as a prerequisite for DNA-binding. Upon dimerization, the alpha-helical content may significantly increase supporting the model of a four-helix bundle dimerization interface. Probably, the HLH domains of both dimer constituents are arranged in a parallel orientation. The leucine zipper consists of repeated leucine residues at every seventh position. The leucines are directed towards one side of an alpha-helix. The leucine side chains of two polypeptides are thought to interdigitate upon dimerization. The leucine zipper of HLH-ZIP proteins may be involved in protein dimerization reactions as well. 
|C0014||MCM1-agamous-deficiens-SRF; 4.4.|Proteins of this class comprise a region of homology. The DNA-binding domain also comprises the dimerization capability. In the DNA-bound dimer (shown for SRF), two antiparallel amphipathic alpha-helices (alpha-I), form a coiled coil and are oriented approximately parallel on the minor groove [1]. These helices make minor and major groove contacts, the N-terminal extensions form minor groove contacts [1]. The bound DNA  is bent and wrapped around the protein. It exhibits a compressed minor groove in the center and widened minor groove in the flanks [1] 
|C0015||high-mobility group protein-like factors; 4.7.|Proteins of this class comprise a region of homology with the chromosomal non-histone HMG proteins such as HMG1. This region comprises the DNA-binding domain which in some instances such as HMG1 mediates sequence-unspecific, in other cases such LEF-1 sequence-specific binding to DNA. This domain exhibits a typical L-shaped conformation made up of 3 alpha-helices and an extended N-terminal extension of the first helix. The latter together with helix 1, which contains a kink, form the long arm of the L, whereas helices 1 and 2 form the short arm. Binding to the minor groove induces a sharp bending of the DNA by more than 90 degree, away from the bound protein. The overall topology of the DNA-protein complexes resembles somewhat that of the TBP-TATA box complex. 
|C0016||Factor family with homology to the ets-protooncogenes; 3.5.2.|The ets-type DNA-binding domain of 85 amino acid residues encompasses three tryptophan residues in characteristic spacing (18-22) similar to the myb-like DNA-binding domain (tryptophan repeat). The last Trp residue is part of an adjacent basic region. There may be (at least) 7 subfamilies comprising Ets1+2, Erg, GABPalpha, PEA3, Elk, Elf and PU.1 factors. Ets domains exert strong major groove contacts to 10 nucleotides around GGA trinucleotide sequences. 
|C0017||paired domain, paired box; 3.2.|DNA-binding domain of approximately 130 amino acid residues. Its N-terminal half is basic, its C-terminal half highly charged in general. It probably comprises 3 alpha-helices 
|C0018||paired domain, paired box + homeo domain; 3.2.1.|A paired box is combined with a C-terminally located homeo domain. The paired box comprises approximately 130 amino acid residues. Its N-terminal half is basic, its C-terminal half highly charged in general. It probably comprises 3 alpha-helices. Three consecutive alpha-helix structures, helix 3 contacts mainly the major groove of the DNA, some contacts at the minor groove are observed as well. Helix 2 and 3 resemble the helix-turn-helix structure of prokaryotic regulators. 
|C0019||cold-shock domain; 4.10.|Cold-shock domain proteins are characterized by a highly conserved region first found in prokaryotic cold-shock proteins [5] [2]. This domain is a single-stranded nucleic acid-binding structure interacting with DNA or RNA. It consists of an antiparallel five-stranded beta-barrel, the strands of which are connected by turns and loops [3] [4]. Within this structure, a three-stranded beta-strand contains a conserved RNA-binding motif, RNP1 [3] [4] [1]. Not all CSD proteins are transcription factors. Those which specifically bind to a certain sequence are termed Y-box proteins. - Proteins of this class were previously called protamine-like domain proteins because of having a highly positively charged domain with interspersed proline residues. 
|C0020||Rel-related factor; 4.1.|The structure of the Rel-type DBD exhibits a bipartite subdomain structure, each subdomain comprising a beta-barrel with five loops that form an extensive contact surface to the major groove of the DNA. Particularly, the first loop of the N-terminal subdomain (the highly conserved recognition loop) performs contacts with the recognition element on the DNA, but other loops are involved. The fact that the main DNA-contacts are made through loops has been suggested to provide a high degree of flexibility in binding to a range of different target sequences. Augmenting interactions are achieved by two alpha-helices within the N-terminal part that form strong minor groove contacts to the A/T-rich center of the  B-element. In p65, the sequence between both alpha-helices is much shorter and even helix 2 is truncated. The second, C-terminal domain is necessary mainly for protein dimerization. 
|C0021||zinc finger + homeo domain; 3.1.4.|Molecule contains a zinc finger motif of TFIIIA/Krueppel type as well as a putative homeo domain. 
|C0022||tryptophan cluster; 3.5.|The tryptophan clusters comprise several tryptophan residues with a spacing of 12-21 amino acid residues; the subclass of myb-type DNA-binding domains typically exhibit a spacing of 19-21 amino acid residues. All IRF family members, except IRF-1 and IRF-2, contain conserved IAD, IRF association domain that is responsible for protein-protein interactions with other IRF family members or with Ets factor PU.1 and/or bHLH factor E47 [1]. IRF-1 and IRF-2 contain IAD2 that is conserved between them and, like IAD, involved in protein-protein interactions [1]. 
|C0023||fork head domain; 3.3.|Identified by homology between HNF-3A and fkh. The domain comprises approx. 110 AA. Analysis of the crystal structure has revealed a compact structure of three alpha-helices, the third alpha-helix being exposed towards the major groove of the DNA. The domain also exerts minor groove contacts. Upon binding to DNA, it induces a bend of 13 degree. 
|C0024||TEA domain; 3.6.|The TEA domain has been identified as a region which is conserved among the transcription factors TEF-1, TEC1 and abaA. This domain in TEF-1 has been shown to interact with DNA, although two additional regions may also contribute to DNA-binding. It is predicted to fold into three alpha-helices, with a randomly coiled region of 16-18 amino acid residues between helices 1 and 2, and a short stretch between helices 2 and 3 of 3-8 residues. 
|C0025||LIM domain plus homeo domain; 3.1.3.1.|Lim motif has been identified by homology between lin-11, Isl-1, and mec-3. It consists of about 60 amino acids with a conserved pattern of cysteine and histidine residues. It is a zinc-binding domain most likely involved in protein-protein contacts [5] [3] [2] [1]. The homeo domain consists of three consecutive alpha-helix structures, helix 3 contacts mainly the major groove of the DNA, some contacts at the minor groove are observed as well. Helix 2 and 3 resemble the helix-turn-helix structure of prokaryotic regulators. 
|C0026||helix-turn-helix.|Contains the motif alpha-helix - beta-turn - alpha-helix known from prokaryotic repressors. 
|C0027||homeodomain plus leucine zipper.|Three consecutive alpha-helix structures, helix 3 contacts mainly the major groove of the DNA, some contacts at the minor groove are observed as well. Helix 2 and 3 resemble the helix-turn-helix structure of prokaryotic regulators. The leucine zipper consists of repeated leucine residues at every seventh position and mediates protein dimerization as a prerequisite for DNA-binding. The leucines are directed towards one side of an alpha-helix. The leucine side chains of two polypeptides are thought to interdigitate upon dimerization (knobs-into-holes model). 
|C0028||LIM domain; 3.1.3.2.|Lim motif has been identified by homology between lin-11, Isl-1, and mec-3. It consists of about 60 amino acids with a conserved pattern of cysteine and histidine residues. It is a zinc-binding domain most likely involved in protein-protein contacts [4] [3] [2] [1]. 
|C0029||runt homology domain; 4.11.|The members of this transcription factor class have been identified on the basis of their homology to a defined region within the Drosophila protein Runt. The runt domain (of RUNX1) contains twelve beta strands, seven of which shape the fold of an immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich (S-type Ig fold) also found in the DNA-binding domains of other transcription factors (NF-kappaB, NFAT, p53, STAT, and the T-domain) that is preceded by an N-terminal alpha helix [1] [6] [5]. The runt domain is responsible for both DNA-binding and heterodimerization which occur at distinct, non-overlapping sites within the domain [2]. Heterodimerization with CBFbeta leads to conformational changes in the runt domain (S-switch) that stabilize DNA binding [4] [3] [1]. 
|C0030||histone fold; 4.8.|The histone fold has been identified in the core histone molecules as DNA-binding and dimerization motif and has subsequently been found in several sequence-specifically binding transcription factors. It comprises an alpha-helix (11 residues), a short loop and beta-strand, a long alpha-helix (27 residues), another short loop and beta-strand, and another alpha-helix (11 residues). It may have been arisen by tandem duplication of a single helix-strand-helix (HSH) structural motif. Within histone molecules, the C-terminal HSH2 motif appears to enter more protein-protein contacts than HSH1, while both HSH motifs contact the DNA. 
|C0031||glial cells missing.|Within the N-terminal parts of Drosophila GCM, human and mouse GCMa and murine GCMb, a region of about 150 AA was disclosed that exhibits a high degree of homology. This gcm-motif is responsible for DNA-binding. Within this motif, three regions of identity were discovered: A, 10 AA; B, 9 AA; C, 10 AA. Additionally, there are 7 conserved Cys and 4 conserved His residues scattered over the gcm-motif. 
|C0032||basic region + helix-span-helix domain; 1.6.|Examining human AP-2 as paradigm of this structural class, a DNA-contacting domain was identified which comprises several clusters of basic amino acid side chains. C-terminally adjacent to it, a dimerization domain was found which consists of two putative alpha-helices separated by a span of over 80 amino acids. This HSH dimerization domain can functionally replace the ZIP dimerization domain of c-Jun [1] 
|C0033||basic domain (superclass); 1.|Proteins belonging to this superfamily contact the DNA through a basic region which free in solution has a random structure, but becomes alpha-helically folded upon binding to DNA [5] [4] [2] [1] [3]. Most prominent classes of this group are the bZIP and bHLH proteins. There is no "consensus" motif for all basic domains of this superfamily. Even the basic regions of bZIP and bHLH factors diverge greatly, although their mode of interacting with the DNA is strictly homologous: A specific alpha-helical dimerization domain provides the linkage between two DNA-contacting basic regions which adopt helical conformation when their positively charged side chains are neutralized by the phosphate backbone of the DNA. 
|C0034||zinc finger (superclass); 2.|In polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIA, a repetitive pattern of cysteine and histidine residues was discovered and, together with the known zinc-dependence of TFIIIA, led to the model of "zinc fingers" of the Cys2His2 type [5] [1]. Shortly after, sequences coding for the estrogen receptor were cloned and revealed a somewhat similar arrangement of cysteine residues only (Cys4), with no additional homologies [3] [4]. Nevertheless, a zinc finger model was proposed for these factors as well and was subsequently proven, with a minor alteration in the Cys pattern [2]. In addition to these two large classes of zinc finger proteins, there are many factors revealing Cys4 zinc fingers of variable composition, such as the GATA-factors, some fungal regulators and adenovirus E1A. Finally, the yeast GAL4-like regulators are grouped together as Cys6 "zinc clusters". 
|C0035||helix-turn-helix (superclass); 3.|The helix-turn-helix superclass is a particularly large and heterogeneous family of transcription factors. Their DNA-binding motif appeared very early during evolution since it is found in prokaryotic and bacteriophage regulators as well as in mammalian transcriptional activators and repressors [3] [2] [1]. Presumably due to this property, most of them fulfill elementary functions in eukaryotes such as developmental regulation and determination of differentiation processes. In general, they comprise a DNA-recognition helix which inserts into the major DNA groove, another one which exerts unspecific stabilizing backbone interactions, and in most cases additional helices which help to stabilize the overall structure of the DNA-binding module. 
|C0036||beta-scaffold factors with minor groove contacts (superclass); 4.|"Non-transitive" superclass comprising several transcription factor classes for which it is difficult to define one common characteristic, but for which a series of characteristics can be listed, each one being shared by many but in no case by all of them. Among these characteristics are: "embracing" the DNA, DNA-bending/ kinking, comprising a beta-scaffold structure, binding the DNA through loops and/or extended regions, exerting minor groove contacts. Most of these DNA-binding domains comprise a more or less extended scaffold of beta-strands (beta-barrel, beta-sandwich, beta-sheet) which serves as a structural template to expose DNA-contacting secondary structure elements, be it alpha-helices, loops, or beta-strands themselves. These factors make extensive DNA-contacts either by embracing the DNA for at least half a turn, as was shown for a member of the Rel-class [5] [1], for p53 multimers [6], for TBP [6] [9] [8] and for HMG domains [7] [2], or wrap the DNA around the protein core. The latter was shown for a MADS-box factor [3] and for the viral regulator E2 [10]. Many of these factors have in common that they bind to A/T-rich cores with C/G-rich flanks, the central interactions made up by minor groove contacts. In the case of the Rel protein NF-6B p50, this central minor groove contact depends on the precise architecture of the binding site [5] [1]. These minor groove interactions with the DNA give rise to drastic distortions of the double helix, with the possible exception of the Rel class. 
|C0037||APETALA2/EREBP-like factors, AP2 domain, ERF domain; 0.5.|The factors belonging to this class share a homology domain with the A. thaliana transcription factor APETALA2 (AP2) [3] [2]. The homolog of this domain in the EREBP factors has been shown to mediate DNA-binding [4] [1]. It comprises an N-terminal basic and hydrophilic YRG element and a C-terminal RAYD element, both of which being variably spaced by 1-15 amino acid residues [3]. The RAYD element contains a predicted amphiphilic alpha-helix [3]. AP2- and EREBP-related proteins form two distinct families within this class, many of the AP2 family factors harboring two AP2 domains [2]. Up to now, the AP2 class comprises only transcription factors of higher plants. 
|C0038||DNA-binding with One Finger.|A single zinc finger motif of C4 type comprising 4 cysteine residues which presumably coordinate one zinc ion [5]; the one zinc finger motif appears to be necessary for DNA-binding [3]; a fifth cysteine residue in the characteristically long zinc finger loop may have negative regulatory importance [2]; also called MOA (MNB1a, OBP1, and AOBP) motif [4] 
|C0039||signal transducers and activators of transcription; 4.2.|
|C0040||WRKY domain together with a novel zinc-finger-like motif.|The WRKY domain is defined by the conserved amino acid sequence WRKYGQK at its N-terminal end, together with a novel zinc-finger-like motif. All known WRKY proteins contain either one or two WRKY domains. They can be classified on the basis of both the number of WRKY domains and the features of their zinc-finger-like motif (C2-H2: C-X 4-5 -C-X 22-23 -H-X 1 -H; C2-HC: C-X 7 -C-X 23 -H-X 1-C). Because of the clear binding  preference of all characterized WRKY proteins for the same DNA motif, it has been assumed that the WRKY domain, as their only conserved structural feature, constitutes a DNA-binding domain. The WRKY domain has sequence-specific DNA-binding activity [1]. 
|C0041||SMA- and MAD (Mother against DPP) related proteins; 4.12.1.|proteins with 2  MAD-homology domains at N- and C-terminal ends, which have been named MH1 and MH2, are independently folded structures [1]; the structure of the MH2 domain is a beta-sandwich with a 3-alpha-helix bundle at one end, and 3 large loops and an alpha-helix at the other end [1]; the loop-helix region of one subunit packs against the 3-alpha-helix bundle of another subunit [1]; MH1, a novel type of DBD, consists of 4 alpha-helixes, 6 short beta-strands, and 5 loops. Beta-strands form 2 small beta-sheets and 1 beta-hairpin [2]; base-specific DNA recognition of the MH1 domain bound to a GTCT motif is via an 11-amino acid beta-hairpin, which lies in the major groove of the DNA [2] [1]; 3 classes of SMAD: Inhibitory SMADs (SMAD-6,SMAD-7), Receptor-regulated SMADs (SMAD-1, SMAD-2, SMAD-3, SMAD-5, SMAD-8), Common Mediator SMADs (SMAD-4, SMAD-4beta, SMAD-10) [1]. 
|C0042||PHD finger.|PHD finger proteins are defined by the presence of a cysteine-rich region N-terminal to the homeodomain. The consensus sequence for this region is C-X2-C-X13-C-X3-C-X4-H-X2-C-X18-C-P-X-C-X-C and it has been postulated that it may function as a domain for protein-protein interactions, as a redox sensitive sensor for environmental signals, or a sequence required for specific DNA binding by the protein [2]. Transcriptional activation is a common feature of PHD fingers, but together with an adjacent leucine zipper transcriptional activation of PHD fingers appears to be silent [1]. 
|C0043||BED finger.|The BED finger which was named after the Drosophila proteins BEAF and DREF, is found in one or more copies in cellular regulatory factors and transposases from plants, animals and fungi. The BED finger is an about 50 to 60 amino acid residues domain that contains a characteristic motif with two highly conserved aromatic positions, as well as a shared pattern of cysteines and histidines that is predicted to form a zinc finger (C-X2-C-XN-H-X3-5-H/C). As diverse BED fingers are able to bind DNA, it has been suggested that DNA-binding is the general function of this domain. 
|C0044||T domain, T-box proteins.|The T domain has originally been discovered in Brachyury (T) the founder member of the T-box family. It encodes a DNA binding domain of about 180 amino acids. X-ray analysis of the T domain showed that it binds as a dimer to a 20 nucleotide partially palindromic sequence. A new type of specific DNA contact is seen, in which a carboxy-terminal helix is deeply embedded into an enlarged minor groove without bending the DNA. 
|C0045||zinc finger + HMG like domain.|The presence of the C2-C2 zinc finger domain and HMG-like domain is characteristic of the YABBY family of putative transcription factors. The HMG-like domain, designated the YABBY domain, has sequence similarity to DNA-binding domains of HMG transcription factors <C0015 > 
|C0046||Trihelix motif.|proteins consist of two autonomous DNA-binding domains, one NH2-terminal and the other COOH-terminal, that discriminate with high resolution between the three GT motifs. A duplicated sequence of 75 amino acids, present once in each DNA-binding domain, appears likely to mediate DNA target element recognition. Each copy of this duplicated protein sequence is predicted to form three amphipathic alpha-helices separated from each other by two short loops [1] 
|C0047||Trihelix motif.|
|C0048||AT-rich interaction domain family.|Highly conserved DNA-binding domain that encompass 108-132 amino acids. The solution structure of the Mrf-2 binding domain contains six helices, two loops and a flexible C-terminus. In the DNA complex Mrf-2 contacts both the major and minor grooves. 
|C0049||RING finger.|The RING finger or C3HC4 finger is a zinc-binding domain that is found in proteins from plants to humans. It can be described in more detail as CX(2)CX(9-39)CX(1-3)HX(2-3)CX(2)CX(4-48)CX(2) where X can be any amino acid. Only a subset of this large family has been identified as transcription factors, they are also involved in various other molecular functions (e.g. signal transduction). RING-finger-containing proteins are often part of multi-protein-complexes and it appears that the RING is involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and not directly mediating binding to DNA. 
|C0050||heat stress transcription factor; 3.4.|modular structure with an N-terminal DNA binding domain characterized by a central helix-turn-helix motif, an adjacent domain with heptad hydrophobic repeats (HR-A/B) involved in oligomerization, a cluster of basic amino acid residues essential for nuclear import (NLS), and an acidic C-terminal activation domain [1] [2] 
|C0051||Grainyhead; 4.9.|Ancient family of factors characterized by a distinct type of DNA binding domain. Members of this class are know in C. elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates, and involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes [1] and references therein. Majority of the factors are activators, but LBP-9 and CRTR-1 are repressors [3] [2]. On the basis of sequence similarity, class can be subdivided into the two families: LSF/CP2 and Grainyhead itself [1]. Members of this class are characterized by the conserved DNA binding- and oligomerization-associated regions [1]. Consensus DNA recognition element of the LSF/CP2 family members represents a direct bipartite repeat CNRG-N(6)-CNRG  [5]. LSF/CP2 factors bind DNA as homotetramers, Drosophila Elf-1 binds as a dimer [4]. 
|C0052||Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells family; 4.1.3.|NF-AT factors were first discovered in T-cells. Upon T-cell activation, NF-AT is dephosphorylated by calcineurin in response to intracellular Ca2+, which exposes the nuclear localization signals. Immunosuppressive drugs inhibiting calcineurin (cyclosporin A and FK506) block nuclear translocation of NF-ATp, reviewed in [15]. Later, NFAT factors have been shown to regulate gene transcription in many different cell types: macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, skeletal and smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, pancreatic islet cells,  adipocytes. In pancreatic islet cells, particular isoforms of NFAT are activated by calcineurin in response to depolarization-induced calcium influx [12]. In vascular endothelial cells, particular isoforms of NFAT are induced by neuropeptide Substance P in a Ca2+ dependent manner [9]. It became evident, that nuclear export on NF-ATs as well as their nuclear import is a highly regulated process. Nuclear export of NF-ATc3 is regulated by JNK2 in exportin Crm1-dependent manner [1]. NF-AT factors in many cases activate transcription synergistically with other transcription factors: AP-1 (Jun-Fos heterodimers) reviewed in [15], Oct [8], Egr-1 [10] [13], IRF-4 [4], C/EBP [3], ICSBP [2]. Interactions of NFAT factors with AP-1 heterodimers has been studied in details. Complex Jun-Fos-NFAT-DNA has been crystallized and formation of common DNA-binding surface has been shown [14]. NFAT1 provides a particular orientation of Jun-Fos heterodimers on DNA in Jun-Fos-NFAT-DNA complexes [6] [7].  A computational method to search for potential composite elements NFAT/AP-1 has been suggested [11]. NFAT5 is the most distant member of the NF-AT family: has no calcineurin binding domain, forms a stable dimer in solution, dimerization is obligatory for DNA binding and transcriptional activity. It  activates cytokine genes in osmotically stressed T-cells [5]. 
|C0053||Homeo domain only, NK-2/Nkx subfamily; 3.1.1.15.|Drosophila NK-homeobox genes were first characterized in 1989 [11]. NK-2/vnd, NK-3/bagpipe and NK-4/tinman are more closely related to one another (59-66% homology) than to other Drosophila homeodomain factors [11]. Later, a number of vertebrate homologs closely related to NK-2 group have been cloned and characterized. Member of this subfamily encoded by about 20 different genes regulate gene transcription in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner.  Nkx2-5, closely related to Drosophila NK-4/tinman, is the earliest marker for cardiogenesis in vertebrate embryos, reviewed in [9] [4]. Nkx3-2, the mammalian NK-3/bagpipe homologue, is essentially required for the spleen, vertebral column and cranium development [5]. Nkx3-1 is the earliest marker of prostate epithelium and plays an important role in maintenance of the differentiated state of prostatic cells [6]. Nkx6-1 has been shown to specifically express in pancreatic beta-cells [10]. Nkx2-2, Nkx2-9 and Nkx6-1 play am important role in neuronal development in brain, reviewed in [2]. Nkx2-1 regulates early growth and development of the lung primordium, reviewed in [1], as well as that of the thyroid gland. Nkx5-1 is the first inner ear-specific molecule that is shown to play a crucial role in the formation of the mammalian vestibular system [7]. NK-4/tinman acts as either a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on its interactions with p300 co-activator or Groucho co-repressor [3]. Structure of NK2-DNA complex has been resolved, helix III of the homeodomain binds in the major groove of the DNA and the N-terminal arm binds in the minor groove [8]. Conserved binding core for NK-2/Nkx subfamily is TAAT. 
|C0057||p53-like; 4.3.|
|C0058||several C2H2 type zinc fingers and BTB/POZ domain.|
|C0059||Smad/NF1; 4.12.|Significant similarities between DNA binding domains of Smad and NF1 factors have been revealed by a PSI-BLAST database search. Authors have proposed that Smad and NF1 factors belong to the same group of genes probably resulting from the common ancestry [1]. For more details about Smad or NF1 factors see <C0041> and <C0060> correspondingly. 
|C0060||NF1/CTF; 4.12.2.|

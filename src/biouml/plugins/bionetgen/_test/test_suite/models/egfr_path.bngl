# The primary focus of the model developed by Kholodenko
# is the cascade of signaling events that lead to 
# recruitment of cytosolic Sos to the inner cell membrane.  
# EGF binds to EGFR, which leads to the formation of signaling-competent 
# receptor dimers.  A dimer then can be transphoshorylated. 
# The cytosolic adapter proteins Grb2 and Shc are recruited to 
# phosphorylated dimer.  
# When Shc is bound to a dimer, it can be phosphorylated by EGFR. 
# The phosphorylated form of Shc interacts with Grb2, which 
# interacts constitutively with Sos.

BioNetGen (*.bngl) format

BioNetGen is a set of software tools for rule-based modeling.
Rule-based modeling involves the representation of molecules 
as structured objects and molecular interactions as rules for
transforming the attributes of these objects. The approach is
 notable in that it allows one to systematically incorporate 
 site-specific details about protein-protein interactions into
a model for for the dynamics of a signal-transduction system,
but the method has other applications as well, such as following
the fates of individual carbon atoms in metabolic reactions. The
consequences of protein-protein interactions are difficult to 
specify and track with a conventional modeling approach because
of the large number of protein phosphoforms and protein complexes
that these interactions potentially generate.
<br>
<br>
A BioNetGen input file contains the information required to
specify a model, including definitions of molecules, rules
for molecular interactions, and model outputs, which are called
"observables". Model definition is delimited by 'begin model' and 'end model' tags.
All of model elements are specified in blocks delimited 
by 'begin block_name' and 'end block_name' tags as 
indicated in example below. The five block types are 'parameters', 
'species' (or 'seed species'), 'reactions', 'observables', 'molecule types'.
Other simulation parameters follow the model specification. All text 
following a '#' character  on a line is treated as a comment, 
and comments may appear anywhere in an input file.
<br>
<br>
The following is a list of of general steps involved in construction
a model with the relevant section of the input file:
<ol>
<li>(parameters) Define the parameters that govern the dynamics 
of the system (rate constants, the values for initial concentration
 of species in the biological system).</li>
<li>(molecule types) Define molecules, including components and 
allowed component states. <i>(optional)</i></li>
<li>(species) Define the initial state of system (initial species
and their concentration).</li>
<li>(reactions) Define rules that describe how molecules interact.</li>
<li>(observables) Define model outputs, which are functions of
concentrations of species having particular attributes.</li>
</ol>
They may appear in any order, although, because of the dependencies the above order is 
the most logical. The model specification is followed by a set of commands (actions) that operate 
on the model. The most important are
<ol>
<li>generate_network,</li>
<li>simulate (simulate_ode, simulate_ssa).</li>
</ol>
Syntax and parameters for BioNetGen actions. Scalar types are int, 0/1 (a boolean), 
string and float. Multi-valued parameters may be either arrays or hashes.

# Comments in BNGL are always preceded with a pound (#) character. 
# so that any text that follows a pound character is ignored. 
# The model file below is commented to help you
# understand the main parts of a BNGL file.  Note that some 
# commands at the end of the model file that allow you to 
# run the model with different simulators are commented out.
# To use these other options, simply remove the pound
# character before the command.

begin model

# The first part of a BNGL file is the parameters
# block, where you can define the rates
# of equations or the starting numbers of
# any of the molecular species.

# Next, we define the set of molecule types in the system.  This is a declaration only, so
# we don't specify how many of each molecules there are, and we have to provide a list
# of all possible state values for each component of each molecule with a tilda (~)
# character.
begin molecule types

# Here is where we declare the starting molecules
# in our simulation.  Each component
# must be assigned a single state value, and
# we have to provide how many of each
# molecule exists in the system.
# The number of starting molecules can also be
# specified with one of the parameters defined earlier

# Finally, X will dephosphorylate 
# regardless of whether or not it is bound
# to Y, although for these rules, it will
# always be unbound to Y if it is phosphorylated.
# Here are the rule definitions:

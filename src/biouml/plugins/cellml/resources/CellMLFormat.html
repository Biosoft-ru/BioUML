<h2>CellML format</h2>

<p>
  CellML is an XML based markup language<span class="ref">1</span> for describing mathematical models.
</p>

<p>
  A CellML model consists of a number of components, each described in their own component element.
  A component can be an entirely conceptual entity created for modeling convenience, or it can have some real
  physical interpretation (for example, it could represent the cell membrane).
</p>
 
<p>
  Each component contains a number of variables, which must be declared by placing a variable element inside
  the component. For example, a component representing a cell membrane may have a variable called V representing
  the potential difference (voltage) across the cell membrane.
</p>

<p>
  Mathematical relationships between variables are expressed within components, using MathML.
  MathML is used to make declarative expressions (as opposed to procedural statements as in a computer
  programming language). However, most CellML processing software will only accept a limited of range
  of mathematics (for example, some processing software requires equations with a single variable
  on one side of an equality). The choice of MathML makes CellML particularly suited for describing
  models that contain differential equations. There is no mechanism for the expression of stochastic models
  or any other form of randomness.
</p>
  
<p>
  Components can be connected to other components using a connection element, which describes the name
  of the two components to be connected, and the variables in the first component that are mapped to variables
  in the second component. Such connections are a statement that the variable in one component is equivalent
  to another variable in another component.
</p>
  
<p>
  CellML models also allow relationships between components to be expressed.
  The CellML specification defines two types of relationship, encapsulation and containment,
  however more can be defined by the user. The containment relationship is used to express that one component
  is physically within another. The encapsulation relationship is special because it is the only relationship
  that affects the interpretation of the rest of the model. The effect of encapsulation is that components
  encapsulated beneath other components are private and cannot be accessed except by the component directly
  above in the encapsulation tree. The modeler is free to use encapsulation as a conceptual tool, and it
  does not necessarily have any physical interpretation.

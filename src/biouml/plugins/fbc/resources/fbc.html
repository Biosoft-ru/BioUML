<h2>Flux Balance Analysis</h2>

<p>
Flux balance analysis is a mathematical approach for analyzing the flow of metabolites through a metabolic network.
</p>

<p>
Metabolic reactions are represented as a stoichiometric matrix <i>S</i>.
The flux through all of the reactions in a network is represented by the vector <i>v</i>.
Flux Balance Analysis seeks to maximize or minimize an objective function <i>Z = c<sup>T</sup>v</i>, 
which can be any linear combination of fluxes, where <i>c</i> is a vector of weights, 
indicating how much each reaction contributes to the objective function.
FBA can thus be defined as the use of linear programming to solve the equation <i>Sv = 0</i> 
given a set of upper and lower bounds on <i>v</i> and a linear combination of fluxes as an objective function.

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
FBC syntax example: a simple four reaction pathway. The reactions are <i>R1, R2, X1, X2</i> with fixed species <i>IN,
OUT, ATP, NADH</i> and variable species <i>A, B</i>.

Using the reagent identity and stoichiometry it is possible to compactly describe this network in terms of its reaction
stoichiometry:

 <div class="formula-text"><img src="fbc_3.png" alt="expression"></div>
 There are capacity constraints in this example:
 <div class="formula-text"><img src="fbc_4.png" alt="expression"></div>
In this example the flux through reaction <i>R2</i> will
be maximized.
Solving this we find that maximization of flux through <i>R2</i> gives an optimal solution <i>R2 = 1</i> with one possible solution for <i>v</i>.

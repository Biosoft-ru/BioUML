<h2>Building Flux Balance DataTable</h2>

<p>
This analysis constructs FBC data table for <b>Flux Balance Constraint</b> analysis. This table contains information about fluxes (reactions):
lower and upper bound, objective function coefficients. If input diagram is <i>sbml-fbc</i>, all data about fluxes is already stored in it
and analysis just convert this information into the result table. If information for some fluxes is missed or diagram is not
<i>sbml-fbc</i> default values specified in parameters will be added to the result table.

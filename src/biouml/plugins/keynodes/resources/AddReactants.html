<h2>Add reactants</h2>

<p>
Results of <b>effector/regulator search</b>, <b>longest chains finder</b> and results of other similar analyses contains only essential
elements, so visualizations of such results, which are usually used as scaffold of the signalling paths, contains only necessary elements.
But if one would like to model all the dynamics or all the fluxes, diagram which contains all reactants/products fro each reaction is needed.
<br>
This analysis adds missing reactants/products to reactions of existing diagram.

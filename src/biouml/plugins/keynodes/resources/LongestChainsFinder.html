<h2>Find longest connected chains</h2>

<p>
Goal of this analysis is to find longest <i>chains</i> which contains as many elements from <b>input collection</b> as possible.
Here <i>chain</i> means a path which starts and ends with the elements from the <b>input collection</b>. In this path length between
two elements from the <b>input collection</b> is limited by <b>maximal search radius</b>.
<br><br>
Analysis uses Dijkstra search algorithm to find all possible chains. Then short chains, or long chains which contains just a few elements
from <b>input collection</b> are cut off using <b>score</b> parameter. Let <i>N<sub>start</sub></i> be a number of elements from 
the <b>input collection</b> in the chain, <i>N<sub>total</sub></i> be a total number of elements in the chain, then score is obtained
using following formula:

<div class="formula-text"><img src="longestChainScore.gif" alt="score"></div>
<p>
where <i>coef</i> is value of <b>score coefficient</b>.

<h2>Drug target search analysis</h2>
<p><b>Goal:</b> to search for important molecules in signal transduction cascade.</p>
<p><b>Input:</b> a set of genes / molecules to start analysis with. For instance, this can be a set of transcription factors, which may result from a promoter analysis, or a set of ligands / receptors that trigger a certain (set of) pathway(s).</p>
<p>Two separate analyses are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Effector search</b> for molecules downstream of the molecules in the input list.</li>
<li><b>Regulator search</b> for molecules upstream of the molecules in the input list.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>A set of proteins or their encoding genes, which may play a key role in regulating (or being regulated by) a maximal number of start molecules.</p>

<h3>Algorithm description</h3>
<p>In drug target search analysis one searches for signaling molecules and corresponding networks that can transmit 
a signal to or receive a signal from several of input molecules within a certain limit of reaction steps. 
A search starts from each molecule of an input set <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> and constructs the shortest paths to all nodes <i>V</i> of the complete network 
within a given maximal path cost <i>R</i> (i.e, the sum of the costs of all edges in the shortest path from a vertex in <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> 
to a vertex in <i>V</i> should be smaller than or equal to <i>R</i>). The search can be conducted in reverse direction of the edges 
leading to input molecules (upstream) or in the same direction (downstream).</p>
<p>The <b>Specificity score</b> is calculated for every molecule found according to:</p>
<div class="formula-text"><img src="score-equation.gif" alt="score"></div>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>R</i></b> — Max radius (input parameter)</li>
<li><b><i>p</i></b> — Penalty (input parameter)</li>
<li><b><i>N(X,r)</i></b> — total number of molecules reachable from key molecule X within the radius r.
<li><b><i>N<sub>max</sub>(r)</i></b> — maximal value of <i>N(X,r)</i> over all key molecules X found for this radius.
<li><b><i>M(X,r)</i></b> — sum of <i>w(X)</i> for all hits reachable from key molecule X within the radius r, where <i>w(X)</i> — weight of hit X.
It equals to <i>w<sub>b</sub>(X)</i> if “Normalize multi-forms” is unchecked. Otherwise it’s <i>w<sub>b</sub>(X)/I(X)</i>, where <i>I(X)</i> is the number of multiforms of X in the input set (not total number of multiforms in the database).
In both cases <i>w<sub>b</sub>(X)</i> is the base weight of hit X. It equals the corresponding value in “Weighting column” or 1 if “Weighting column” is not specified.
<li><b><i>M<sub>max</sub>(r)</i></b> — maximal value of <i>M(X,r)</i> over all key molecules X found for this radius.
</ul>
<p><b>FDR</b>
Each individual drug target molecule gets a <i>p</i>-value (FDR) assigned, which represents the probability to occupy the observed rank or higher ranks 
by random chance. It is estimated on-the-fly by random sampling. The ranking of the key nodes is defined by sorting them according 
to the Score above in descending order. It should be noted that the rank is defined by the ranks of the occurring scores, 
which means that more than one key node can share the same score value in some cases. 
Molecules which do not have any hits get assigned the last rank since the score is zero in this case.</p>
<b><i>Z</i>-Score</b>
<br/>
In addition to the FDR, each drug target molecule gets a <i>Z</i>-Score
<div class="formula-text"><img src="z-score.gif" alt="score"></div>
<p>which measures the deviation of the observed rank <i>X</i> of the key node from the expected rank <i>&mu;</i> in random case, divided by the standard deviation. 
In this formula, the rank above distribution is assumed to comply the normal distribution. Key nodes with <i>Z</i> greater than 1.0 are considered significant.</p>
<h4>Context algorithm</h4>
<p>For the purpose of incorporating additional contextual knowledge, e.g. a certain disease which we know to be related to 
the anticipated analysis, we implemented a method which encodes this additional context information as modified edge costs 
in the signaling network. The context information has to be provided as a second gene set (context genes). 
The idea is based on attracting the drug target molecule search (e.g. the underlying Dijkstra algorithm for shortest paths) towards 
context genes by decreasing the costs of those edges that are close to the context genes. It features two major aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attraction ("gravity") of the shortest-paths towards context genes C</li>
<li>Distribution of the attraction power to an extended surrounding area around C in order to prefer shortest paths close 
to context genes in case there is no path possible that goes through the context gene directly. ("gravity range").</li>
</ol>

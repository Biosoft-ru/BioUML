<h2>Find shortest path between two sets</h2>

<p>
Analysis finds the shortest paths (in the specified direction: upstream, downstream of both) from molecules of the
<b>Start set</b> to the molecules of the <b>End set</b>. Length of such paths is limited by the selected <b>maximal search radius</b>.
<br><br>
It outputs the table where each row corresponds to the molecule from the <b>Start set</b>. And for each row of this table column
'<i>Hit names</i>' it contains all molecules from the <b>End set</b> for which was found the path from the appropriate molecule
from the <b>Start set</b>.

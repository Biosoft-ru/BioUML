<h2>Mass conservation analysis</h2>

<p>
  The mass conservation analysis involves the decomposition of the stoichiometric matrix <i>N</i>
  into the product of two matrixes:
  
  <div class="formula-text"><i>N = L &times; N<sub>R</sub></i>,</div>
  
  where <i>N<sub>R</sub></i> is the reduced stoichiometry consisting of the linearly independent rows of the matrix <i>N</i>
  and <i>L</i> is the link matrix.
</p>

<p>
  To find such decomposition, we use the Gauss-Jordan method
  detecting the left null space <i>&Gamma;</i> of the matrix <i>N</i><span class="ref">1</span>, so that
  
  <div class="formula-text"><i>&Gamma; &times; N </i> = 0.</div>
  
  The matrix <i>&Gamma;</i> specifies the conservation laws of the system, ie.
  linear combinations of species concentrations which remain constant over time.

  Generation of the matrix <i>&Gamma;</i> is based on the premultiplication of <i>N</i>
  by a series of elementary matrixes. In particular, rows of this matrix and hence
  the species order are permutated.
  
  Thus, eliminating from the matrix <i>N</i> all rows corresponding to the species which result in the null space,
  we find the matrix <i>N<sub>R</sub></i>. In addition, the matrix <i>L</i> consists of the identity matrix rows
  and rows defined by <i>&Gamma;</i> arranged according to the species order in the matrix <i>N</i>.

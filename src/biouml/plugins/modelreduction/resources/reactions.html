<h2>Model reactions analysis</h2>

<p>
  Method for finding linear, monomolecular and pseudo-monomolecular reactions of a model.
</p>

<p>
  Reaction is <i>linear</i> if its kinetic law is linear.
</p>

<p>
  Reaction is <i>monomolecular</i> if it has only one reactant or only one modifier.
</p>

<p>
  Reaction is <i>pseudo-monomolecular</i> if ratios of its reactants/modifiers greater
  than specified threshold or smaller than threshold<sup>-1</sup>.

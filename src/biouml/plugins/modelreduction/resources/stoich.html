<h2>Stoichiometric Matrix</h2>

<p>
  The stoichiometric matrix <i>N</i> provides the linear relationship of the model between the flux rates
  of the (enzymatic) reactions and the derivatives of the reactant (enzyme) concentrations.
</p>

<p>
  If a reaction network has <i>n</i> reactions and <i>m</i> participating molecular species
  then the dynamic mass balance equation can be written as

  <div class="formula-text"><img src="stoich1.png" alt="expression"></div>
  
  where <i>v</i> is the flux vector and <i>S</i> is the concentration vector:
  
  <div class="formula-text"><img src="stoich2.png" alt="expression"></div>
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
  Consider the following system of reactions:
  
  <div class="formula-text"><img src="stoich3.png" alt="expression"></div>
  
  This systems comprises four reactions and five different molecular species.
  The stoichiometry matrix for this system can be written as:
  
  <div class="formula-text"><img src="stoich4.png" alt="expression"></div>
  
  where the rows correspond to <i>S</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>S</i><sub>2</sub>,
  <i>S</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>S</i><sub>4</sub> and <i>S</i><sub>5</sub>, respectively.
  Note that the process of converting a reaction scheme into a stoichiometry matrix
  can be a lossy transformation, for example, the stoichiometries in the second reaction
  simplify when included in the matrix.

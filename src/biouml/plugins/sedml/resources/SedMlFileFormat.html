<p>The <b>Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML)</b> is an XML-based format for encoding 
simulation experiments, following the requirements defined in the <a href="http://biomodels.net/miase/">MIASE guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>SED-ML allows the definition of the model(s) to be used, the experimental task(s) to be run, and the result(s) to be produced. 
SED-ML currently only covers some of the requirements for MIASE compliant simulation descriptions. On the other hand, 
the formalisation of SED-ML forces the information to be more precise than the bare MIASE requirements.</p>

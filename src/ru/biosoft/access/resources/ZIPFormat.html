<h2>ZIP file format</h2>

<p>
  The ZIP file format is a data compression and archive format. Actually different archive formats are supported
  including .zip, .tar, .gz and their combinations (e.g. .tar.gz).
</p>
<p>
  A ZIP file must contain one or more files of the same format supported by BioUML. During the import you have to specify
  importer for files in ZIP which will be used for all the files inside ZIP-archive. Please select it carefully as autodetect doesn't work there. 
  If you have files in the different formats
  archived together (e.g. tabular data and BED tracks) and want to import all of them in the system, you'll have to import 
  several times.

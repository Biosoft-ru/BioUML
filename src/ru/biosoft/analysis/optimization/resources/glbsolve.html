<h2>GLBSOLVE algorithm</h2>

<p>
  A deterministic global optimization method<span class="ref">1</span>. It is a version of
  the DIRECT algorithm<span class="ref">2</span> that handles nonlinear and integer constraints.
  The first step in the DIRECT algorithm is to transform the search space to be the unit hypercube. 
  The function is then sampled at the center-point of this cube. Computing the function value at
  the center-point instead of doing it at the vertices is an advantage when dealing with problems
  in higher dimensions. The hypercube is then divided into smaller hyperrectangles whose center-
  points are also sampled. Instead of using a Lipschitz constant when determining the rectangles
  to sample next, DIRECT identifies a set of potentially optimal rectangles in each iteration. All
  potentially optimal rectangles are further divided into smaller rectangles whose center-points are
  sampled. When no Lipschitz constant is used, there is no natural way of defining convergence
  (except when the optimal function value is known as in the test problems). Instead, the procedure
  described above is performed for a predefined number of iterations.

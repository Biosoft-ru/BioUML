<h2>Multi-objective cellular genetic algorithm (MOCell)</h2>

<p>
  The cellular model of the genetic algorithms works on a single population of candidate solutions (individuals)<span class="ref">1</span>.
  MOCell is an adaptation of the algorithm to the multi-objective field<span class="ref">2</span>.
  The main steps of the algorithm are the following.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Initialization.</b> The one individual in the initial population is defined by the user,
  the others are uniformly randomly generated.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Evaluation.</b> Once we initialized the population, or when a new solution
    offspring is created, it is necessary to calculate the fitness values
    for all individuals in this population. For this purpose, we need to find
    values of objective and penalty functions. (The latter is
    in the case of the constraint optimization.)
</p>
<p>
  <b>Selection.</b> Through the selection, we favor solutions,
  which have the highest fitness value (that means the lowest values
  of both objective and penalty function values) in the search.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Recombination.</b> The recombination combines two parent solutions
  for creating a new offspring using Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX). 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mutation.</b> The mutation randomly modifies the offspring using the polynomial operator.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Replacement.</b> Individuals of the offspring population created through selection,
  recombination and mutation, replace individuals of the parent population if their fitness values are higher.

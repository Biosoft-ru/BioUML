<h2>Agilent Normalization</h2>

<p>
  Normalization of Agilent files based on the functions of the
  <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/help/bioc-views/release/bioc/html/limma.html">Bioconductor LIMMA package</a>.
</p>  

<p>
  Smyth and Speed<span class="ref">1</span> give an overview of the normalization techniques
  implemented in these functions.
</p>

<p>
  Usually data from spotted microarrays will be normalized using the function <tt>normalizeWithinArrays</tt>.
  A minority of data will also be normalized using <tt>normalizeBetweenArrays</tt> if diagnostic plots
  suggest a difference in scale between the arrays:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt><a href="http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/limma/html/normalizeWithinArrays.html">normalizeWithinArrays</a></tt> - normalize the expression log-ratios for one or more two-color
    spotted microarray experiments so that the log-ratios average to zero within each array or sub-array;
  <li><tt><a href="http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/limma/html/normalizebetweenarrays.html">normalizeBetweenArrays</a></tt> - normalizes expression intensities so that the intensities or
    log-ratios have similar distributions across a set of arrays.
</ul>

<p>
  For analyzing single-channel information rather than differential expression based on log-ratios,
  the data should be normalized using a single channel-normalization technique.
  Single channel normalization uses further options of the
  <tt>normalizeBetweenArrays</tt> function.
</p>

  <b>Note</b>: Before the Agilent Normalization is started you need to install R and Rserve on your computer.

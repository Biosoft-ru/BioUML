<h2>Convert table identifiers using BioHub(s)</h2>

<p>
  This analysis changes the type of identifiers in the table and converts rows accordingly using a chain of BioHubs.
  A BioHub is a converter between two or more types (for example, convert <i>"Genes: Ensembl"</i> into <i>"Proteins: Ensembl"</i>).
  If direct conversion between two given types is impossible, this analysis will create the optimal chain of several BioHubs and use them subsequently.

  Note that several non-trivial situations might occur during conversion:
  <ul>
    <li>Single source ID matches to several target IDs. In this case source row will be copied several times, one copy per one target ID.
    <li>Source ID doesn't match to any target ID. In this case source row will be removed from result.
    <li>Several source ID's match to single target ID. In this case two options available: 
      <ul>
        <li>You have specified main column. Of all suitable source rows only one will be selected to be put into result,
          based on specified aggregator. For example, if you specified 'maximum' as an aggregator,
          source row with maximal value in main column will be selected from suitable rows.
        </li>      
        <li>
          You have not specified main column. All the corresponding source rows will be merged together using merging rules.
          Non-trivial columns like 'Graph' will be removed from result. Text columns will have all values joined into
          sorted comma-separated list with duplicates removed. Numerical columns will be merged based on selected aggregator.
          For example, if you select 'average' as an aggregator, then mean value will appear in the result.
          If your source column have integral type, some aggregators may change it to float.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

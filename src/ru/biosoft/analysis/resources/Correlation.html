<h2>Correlation Analysis</h2>

<b>Correlation analysis</b> uses standard statistical methods to calculate correlation between two data sets which indicates measure of statistical dependency between them. Input of the analysis are two data sets. Output is a table containing all posible correlations between them and their P-values. For example if input has two data sets one of which contains n samples and another - m samples, then result will contain n x m correlation values and n x m P-values.
One should keep in mind that analysis may produce huge amount of data and take a long time to work, especially if <b>Calculate FDR</b> flag is set "true". 

<h3>Parameters:</h3>

<ul class="analysis-parameters">
  <li><b>Experiment data</b> - experimental data for analysis.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Table</b> - a table data collection with experimental data stored in the BioUML repository.
      <li><b>Columns</b> - the columns selected from the table for further analysis.
    </ul>
    
    <li><b>Control data</b> - control data for analysis.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Table</b> - a table data collection with control data stored in BioUML repository.
        <li><b>Columns</b> - the columns selected from the table for further analysis.
      </ul>
    <p>Please note that, despite their names, both experiment and control data sets has equal meaning, since correlation is a symmetric function.</p> 
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Data source</b> - data source for correlations (rows or columns from tables).
    <li><b>Result type</b> - the type of result representation: correlation matrix or triplets (id1, id2, correlation). 
    <li><b>Correlation type</b> - the correlation method.
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Pearson</b> - Pearson correlation.
      <li><b>Spearman</b> - Spearman rank correlation (non-parametric).
    </ul>
    
    <li><b><i>P</i>-value threshold</b> - threshold for <i>P</i>-value (only elements with lower <i>P</i>-value will be included in the results).
    
    <li><b>Outline boundaries</b> - lower and upper boundaries for values from the input table. Outliers will be ignored.

    <li>
      <b>Output table</b> - the path in BioUML repository where the result table will be stored.
      If a table with the specified path already exists it will be replaced.
    </li>
  </li>

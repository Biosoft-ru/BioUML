<h2>Hypergeometric analysis</h2>

<p>
  This method was designed for identification of down- and up-regulated genes.
  Unlike other up and down identification methods for the same purpose, it compares expression levels to some constant level 
  (<i>BV</i> - Boundary Value), and measures for a given expression profile the probability of obtaining
  expression values that are higher (in the case of up regulated genes) or lower (for down-regulated genes)
  than <i>BV</i> by randomly permutating of the input table and deriving random row from it. If the control is set, the the program will first 
  divide data in the experiment table according to the average value from the control set.
  As input we have one or two tables with names of genes as keys and rows containing the expression values.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> If control is set then result will be calculated only for elements which are present in both experimental
  and control tables!
</p>

<p>
  For each gene we test the null hypothesis and calculate a score that accumulates the information obtained for the
  gene: The sign of the score indicates whether the gene is found to be up- or down-regulated, the absolute value of the score is equal to log(<i>P-value</i>) where <i>P-value</i> is the probability of mistakenly considering the gene element as disregulated
  (lower <i>P-value</i> (hence higher absolute score value) means more reliable result).
</p>  
  
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> elements are considered in the context of whole element pool, considering that for almost every
  element from table null hypothesis is true (experiment and control are not different significantly).
</p>

<p>
  Method have rank character it does take into account only relationships between values so it
  is very robust to outlines.

  <li data-property="controlData"><b>Control</b> - control data for analysis (not obligatory).
    <ul>
      <li><b>Table</b> - a table data collection with control data stored in the BioUML repository.
      <li><b>Columns</b> - the columns from the table which should be taken into account.

  </li>
  
  <li data-property="outputType"><b>Output type</b> - the type of genes to be included in the result table:
    <ul>
      <li>Up- and down-regulated
      <li>Up-regulated
      <li>Down-regulated
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li data-property="pvalue"><b><i>P-value</i> threshold</b> - the threshold for the <i>P-value</i> (only genes with lower <i>P-value</i> will be included in the results)

  <li data-property="threshold"><b>Outline boundaries</b> - lower and upper boundaries for values from the input table. Outliers will be ignored.

  <li data-property="bv">
    <b>Boundary value</b> - an expression will be compared with that value.
    If you want to compare experimental data with control you should set it equal to 1.
  </li>

  <li data-property="fdr">
    <b>Calculate FDR</b> - the test method for calculation of False Discovery Rate (FDR) -
    an average rate of mistakenly found up or down
    regulated genes with a given <i>P-value</i> threshold. It random permutates the data 50 times and applies 
    hypergemetric test to each randomized set. FDR is calculated separately for up and down regulated
    genes according to the formula:

  <li data-property="outputTablePath">
    <b>Output table</b> -  the path in BioUML repository where the result table will be stored.
    If a table with the specified path already exists it will be replaced.

<h3>Method details</h3>

<p>
  Let us denote: <i>Y</i> = &#123;<i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>, ...,<i>Y</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>&#125; &#8212; as the measurements
  of the gene expression for m patients, where:

  <div class="formula-text"><img src="hg1.png" alt="expression"></div>

  is the ratio of actual and control signals.
  The analysis checks the hypothesis <i>H</i><sub>0</sub>: <i>Y</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = <i>BV</i> &#8704;<i>i</i>.
</p>

<p>
  <i>BV</i> (Boundary Value) &#8212; - is designed for discrimination between up- and down-regulation.
  As a critical statistic we use:

  <div class="formula-text"><img src="hg2.png" alt="statistic"></div>

  In the case that the <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> hypothesis is true, our statistic will be distributed like hypergeometric
  random value with parameters <i>N</i>, <i>M</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>m</i>, where
  <ul class="parameters">
    <li><i>n</i> is the total number of clones(genes) which expression is measured in experiment.
    <li><i>M</i> is the amount of values which are greater or equal then <i>Y</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>
    <li><i>N</i> = <i>mn</i> is the total amount of expression measurements in the table.
    <li><i>m</i> is the total number of patients.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We suppose that for almost all genes in the table the <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> hypothesis is true.
  So, for every statistic we estimate temporary <i>P-values</i> as:
  
  <div class="formula-text"><img src="hg3.png" alt="tempPval"></div>
  
  As final <i>P-value</i> for gene we take:
  
  <div class="formula-text"><img src="hg4.png" alt="Pval"></div>
  
  Finally a gene is considered as
  <ul>
    <li><b>Up-regulated</b> if the expression value with the best <i>P-value</i> is lower than <i>BV</i>, and the <i>P-value</i> passes threshold.</li>
    <li><b>Down-regulated</b> if the expression value with the best <i>P-value</i> is greater than <i>BV</i>, and the <i>P-value</i> passes threshold.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <i>P-value</i> here is the estimated probability of this consideration to be wrong.

<h2>Meta-analysis</h2>

<p>
  The aim of a meta-analysis is to identify up- and down-regulated genes from different independent microarray experiments. 
  Such a meta-analysis is based on the hypergeometric analysis method.
  Within the framework of a meta-analysis, a hypergeometric analysis is applied to
  sets of gene profiles. The obtained results are the initial data for a subsequent meta-analysis.
  It uses the same procedure as a hypergeometric analysis for testing the hypothesis
  that the that score obtained in previous tests deviates from 0
  (Boundary Value = 0) just by chance. The result is a table with
  meta scores that indicate.

<h3>Parameters:</h3>

<ul class="analysis-parameters">
  <li data-property="tablePaths">
    <b>Tables</b> - tables from the input data collection to be used for the meta analysis<br>
    Note: for proper work tables should have only one column with scores
    obtained by Hypergeometric analysis (without fold change, details or annotations).
  </li>
  
  <li data-property="outputType"><b>Output type</b> - the type of genes to be included in result:
    <ul>
      <li>Up- and down-regulated
      <li>Up-regulated
      <li>Down-regulated
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li data-property="pvalue"><b><i>P-value</i> threshold</b> - threshold for <i>P-value</i> (only elements with lower <i>P-value</i> will be included in the results).
    
  <li data-property="fdr">
    <b>Calculate FDR</b> - the test method for calculation of False Discovery Rate (FDR) -
    an average rate of mistakenly found up- or down-regulated genes under the given <i>P-value</i> threshold. It randomly permutates the data 50 times and applies the selected
    meta-analysis to each randomized table. FDR is calculated separately for up- and down-regulated
    genes according to the formula:

    <div class="formula-text"><img src="fdr.png" alt="fdr"></div>
  </li>
  
  <li data-property="outputTablePath">
    <b>Output table</b> - the path in the BioUML repository where the result table will be stored.
    If a table with the specified path already exists it will be replaced.
  </li>
</ul>

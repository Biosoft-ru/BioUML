<h2>Quantile normalization</h2>
<p>Quantile normalization is a technique for making two or more distributions identical in statistical properties. 
Each of the columns of the input table is accepted by this method as independent distribution.
</p>
<p>
To quantile normalize two or more distributions to each other, sorting will be applied and then set to the average (arithmetic mean) 
of the distributions. So the highest value in all cases becomes the mean of the highest values, the second highest value becomes 
the mean of the second highest values, and so on.

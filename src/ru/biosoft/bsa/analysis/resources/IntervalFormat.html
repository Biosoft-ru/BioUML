<h2>Interval format</h2>

<p>
  The interval format is pretty much like BED format, but only first three columns are well-defined; others can be used for any purpose.
</p>

<p>
  The first three required fields are:
</p>
  
<ol>
  <li><b>chrom</b> - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671).
  
  <li>
    <b>chromStart</b> - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold.
    The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b>chromEnd</b> - The ending position of the feature in the
    chromosome or scaffold. The <i>chromEnd</i> base is not included in the
    display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a
    chromosome are defined as <i>chromStart=0, chromEnd=100</i>, and span
    the bases numbered 0-99.
  </li>
</ol>

Other fields (if exist) will be loaded into site properties with names field1, field2 and so on.

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
  Here's an example of track in interval format with additional allele information:
</p>

<pre>
chr22 1000 1001 A C
chr22 1005 1005 - GT
chr22 1010 1012 GC T
</pre>

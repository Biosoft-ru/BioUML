<p>This is an advanced version of MACS 1.3.7. In this version during the model building, MACS will pick out the enriched regions which are not too high and not too low to build the paired-peak model. Default the region is from fold 10 to fold 30. If MACS fails to build the model, by default it will use the nomodel settings, like shiftsize=100bps, to shift and extend each tags.</p>

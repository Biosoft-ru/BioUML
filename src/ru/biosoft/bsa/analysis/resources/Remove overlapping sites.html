<h2>Remove overlapping sites</h2>
<p>Constructs subset of input track so that no sites overlap in the output track.
 The 'Overlapping site selection mode' parameter controls wich sites will be selected from the set of overlapping sites.
 'One longest', 'One shortest', 'One with best value' and 'One random' modes will select single site from the set of overlapping sites.
 Other modes can select more then one site from the set of overlapping sites, but resulting sites will not overlap each other.
 'Largest set' mode constructs non-overlapping set of sites with maximal number of sites.
 'Longest set' mode constructs non-overlapping set with largest total length of sites.
 'Set of best sites' mode iteratively selects the best site and removes sites that overlap best site, then selects the best from remaining and removes sites that overlap best site, and so on until no sites remain.</p>

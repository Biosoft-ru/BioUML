<p>Analysis "Matrices to molecules" is designed to convert site model IDs (e.g. matrices) into transcription factors. </p>

<p>
As input, any table with site model IDs (e.g. matrices) can be taken. Such tables may result from several analyses including "Site search on gene set" and "Site search on track".
</p>

<p>
For this conversion, the links between transcription factors and matrices, as they are curated in the corresponding database, are used. The database is selected based on the profile you choose. Currently you can choose either TRANSFAC or GTRD profiles.  Output from "Matrices to molecules" is a list of transcription factors as a gene set. Type of identifiers for the resulting table can be selected in the field "Output type".  Table of transcription factors resulting from this analysis can be used as input for other analyses, for example, as input for master regulator search.

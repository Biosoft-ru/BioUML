** Description **

SISSRs is a software application for precise identification of genome-wide transcription factor binding
sites from ChIP-Seq data. It is essentially a perl implementation of the SISSRs algorithm outlined in
Jothiet et al, 2008, with several new features that were not fully described in the original paper.

ChIP-Seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with next generation massively
parallel sequencing, is a powerful experimental technique to determine whether proteins including,
but not limited to, transcription factors bind to specific regions on chromatin in vivo. In ChIP-Seq, the DNA
fragments obtained from ChIP are directly sequenced using the next generation genome sequencers such as
Illumina Genome Analyzers. Although the lengths of the input DNA could be anywhere between ~200
bp and 1 kb, typically, only the first 25-50 nt from the DNA ends are sequenced. The resulting short
reads are mapped back to a reference genome, and only those reads that map to an unique genomic locus
in the reference genome are considered for further analysis. Mapped reads are commonly referred to as
tags (henceforth, 'reads' and 'tags' are used interchangeably).

A binding site is a region on the DNA to which specific proteins including, but not limited to,
transcription factors bind in vivo. A typical binding site could be anywhere between ~5-20 nucleotides in
length.

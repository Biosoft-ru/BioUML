<h2>Tabular file formats</h2>

<p>
	Tabular file format represents the table. Several formats are supported including tab-separated (*.txt, *.tab), comma-separated (*.csv), and
	Microsoft Excel Workbooks (*.xls, *.xlsx). During the import additional parameters can be specified. Some parameters may appear only after file upload as they depends on the file structure.
	Most of parameters will be auto-detected by the system, but you should review them carefully as auto-detection may not work for some specific files.

<b>Parameters:</b>
<ul class="analysis-parameters">
<li data-property="properties/sheet"><b>Sheet name</b> (for MS Excel only) &ndash; which workbook sheet you want to import. Only one sheet may be imported at once.
<li data-property="properties/delimiterType"><b>Column delimiter</b> (n/a for MS Excel) &ndash; specify which symbol separates the columns.
<li data-property="properties/processQuotes"><b>Process quotes</b> &ndash; if checked, then column delimiter inside "quoted" values will be ignored. The quote symbols themselves will be removed.
<li data-property="properties/headerRow"><b>Header row index</b> &ndash; number of row (starting from 1) at which column headers are located. If there are no column headers in your file, please specify 0. In this case
table columns will be named as "Column#1", "Column#2" and so on. You will be able to rename them later.
<li data-property="properties/dataRow"><b>First data row index</b> &ndash; number of row (starting from 1) at which actual data starts. All rows from this till the end of the file will be loaded.
<li data-property="properties/columnForID"><b>Column for ID</b> &ndash; select the column which will be used as row ID. In the system each table row must have unique identifier (key) which will be used in many analyses.
If you have genes list, then column containing Entrez gene ID or Ensembl gene ID will be fine. If you have Affymetrix probes, then Probe ID column should be selected.
You may also use "Generate unique ID" option to generate incrementing numbers and use them as row IDs.
<li data-property="properties/addSuffix"><b>Add suffixes to repeated ID</b> &ndash; if checked and repeated entries encountered in the ID column, then suffixes will be added to keep row IDs unique.
If not checked, then rows with repeated IDs will be ignored.
<li data-property="properties/tableType"><b>Type of the table</b> &ndash; select the type of identifiers in the ID column. Usually it's detected automatically. It's very important option as many analyses require
tables of the specific type.
<li data-property="properties/species"><b>Species</b> &ndash; select the species the data in the table is associated with or "Unspecified" if it's not associated with any species.
